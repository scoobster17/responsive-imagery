Serve the files
---------------

This project depends on serve to be installed globally. Please run the following
command (assuming you have node and npm installed):

```
npm install serve -g
```

There is a pre-written command to serve the files to save you typing them out
each time, although this may need to be modified locally. Please adjust the port
number and path in the script in the ```package.json``` file as required.

Run the following command to be able to access the test @ ```http://localhost:7352```

```
npm run serve
```
